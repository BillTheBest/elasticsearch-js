h1. ElasticSearch Javascript Client Demos

This folder contains several demos of ElasticSearch JavaScript client.

h2. System Statistics Monitoring

"stats":http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/elasticsearch-js/blob/master/demo/stats demo is showing how to build simple one page system monitor with live charts (JVM, OS, ...)

h2. Demo

This "demo":http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/elasticsearch-js/blob/master/demo/demo comes with simple html page that allows
for execution of individual built-in methods in JavaScript client (not all of the methods are exposed right now but many).
This demo is used mainly during development and is probably not interesting to users a lot.

h2. Query

ES client provides a lot of built-in methods and the goal is to cover REST API completely but it can happen that you need
to issue a specific request or simply there is a new API that is not supported by JS client yet. In this case it can be
handy to use @request(method, path, data, callback)@ method.
Check "query":http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/elasticsearch-js/blob/master/demo/query demo for simple demonstration about
how you can do it.

h2. Simple

"simple.html":http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/elasticsearch-js/blob/master/demo/simple.html is very basic demonstration of
how ES client can be used (this demo is referenced from the main page).
