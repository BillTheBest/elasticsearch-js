h1. System Statistics Monitoring

This demo shows how to build simple system monitor, it is a one page with some live charts (JVM, OS, ...) and some info about cluster nodes:

 * provide info about:
 ** JVM details
 ** OS details

 * provides charts about:
 ** JVM threads
 ** JVM Heap and non-heap memory
 ** OS CPU(%)
 ** OS Mem
 ** OS Swap

User can switch between nodes in the cluster, new nodes are added and old nodes are removed automatically on the fly.

On top of that it is possible to set refresh interval and time window for the charts (no limits, 1 minute, 5 minutes, ... etc)
