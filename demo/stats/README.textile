h1. System Statistics Monitoring

This demo shows how to build simple system monitor, it is a one page with some live charts (JVM, OS, ...):

 * provides charts for:
 ** JVM threads
 ** JVM Heap and non-heap memory
 ** OS CPU(%)
 ** OS Swap

On top of that you can set refresh interval and time window for the charts (no limits, 1 minute, 5 minutes, ... etc)

It is work in progress and has some hardcoded limitations:
 * it shows statistics of the first node found in the response (does not allow to choose node)
 * does not implement chart for OS memory
