h1. System Statistics Monitoring

This demo shows how to build simple system monitor, it is a one page with some live charts (JVM, OS, ...):

 * provides charts for:
 ** JVM threads
 ** JVM Heap and non-heap memory
 ** OS CPU(%)
 ** OS Swap

User can switch between nodes in the cluster, new nodes are added and old nodes are removed automatically on the fly.

On top of that you can set refresh interval and time window for the charts (no limits, 1 minute, 5 minutes, ... etc)

It is work in progress and has some hardcoded limitations:
 * does not implement chart for OS memory
